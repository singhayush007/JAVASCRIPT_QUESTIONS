What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

->Synchronous Programming means that tasks are executed one after the other . Each task must finish before the next one starts. This can block the execution if a task take a long time.
->Asynchronous Programming allows aks to run soncurrently . this means that while one task is waiting (liek fetching data), other tasks can continue executing without waiting.

Explain the concept of promises in JavaScript.
->A promise is an object that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows you to write clener code without nesting ,ultiple callBacks.
State of Promises:
* Pending: The intial state, neither fullfiled nor rejected.
* Fulfiled : The operation completed successfully.
* rejected : The operation failed.

What are callback functions? How are they used?
->A callback function is a function that passes as an arguemnt to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed .This is a commonly used in asynchronous programming.

What are Javascript prototypes and how they work?
->Prototypes are a mechansim by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another . Every Javascript object has a prototype object from which it can inherit properties and methods.

What is event loop in javascript ? How does it work with asynchronous code ?
->The event Loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations despite being single-threaded . It manages the execution of code , collects and processes events and execution queued sub-tasks.
->When asynchronous taks (like fetching data) are completed , their callbacks are added to the callback queue. The evnent loop continuoulsy checks the call stack and the callback queue to execute tasks.

*Illustrations of the EventLoops:
1: Call Stack : Where function are executed
2: Web API's : For handling asynchronous tasks like setTimeout, fetch
3: Callback Queue : Holds the callback from compleetd asynchronous tasks.
4: Event Loop: Checks if the call stack is empty , then moves the first callback from teh callback queue to the call stack.

Explain how map() , filter() , reduce() function work.
-> These are higher order function for manipulating arrays:

map(): Creates a new array by applying a function to each element if the original array.
filter() : Creates a new array with all eleemnts that pass the test implementted by the provided function.
reduce() : Executes a reducer function on each element of the array , resulting in a single output value. 

What is the purpose of async and await in JavaScript?
-> Async and await are used to work with promisies in a more readable way.
-> Async is a keyword that you can place before a function declaration to indicate that the function will return a promise.
-> Await is used inside an async function to pause execution until the promise  resolved.

How does javascript handle memory mnagement and garbage collection?
-> JavaScript hs automatically memory management , which means that developers do not need to manally allocate free memory.
-> Garbage collectio is the process of automatially reclaiimng memory that is no longer in use. It tracks object that are no longer referenced in the cde and frees thier memory.
-> JavaScript primarily uses mark and sweep garbage collection , where it marks reachable objects and sweeps away unmarked (unreachable) objects.

What is the debounce function in javascript ? How is it different from throttle ?
-> Debounce 
Main Definition: Debounce ensure that a function is executed only after a specified timehas passed since. It was last invoked .Thsi is helpful when you want to avoid running a function too frequently , such as during user input.

Real Life Example: Imagine you are typing in a search box . You don't wnt to search every time a letter is typed instead you want the search to occcur after you stop typing for a moment .

-> Throttle 
Main Definition: Throttle ensures that a function is executed at most once in a specified period of time.This is useful for events that can occur continuoulsy , such as acrolling or resizing a window.
Real Life Example: Think about a traffic light. It changes color at set ntervals , regardless of whether cas are still arriving . Throttling means allowing an action to happen at a limited rate.

What is destructuring in JavaScript? 
-> Destructuring is a syntax that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
